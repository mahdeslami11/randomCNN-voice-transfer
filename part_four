Subjective evaluation and conclusion


This Innovation has the best results among all current works  in voice style transfer .
but the cost is that :
1.	Heavy architecture. the architecture is to training 2 networks, 
Net one classifier and Net two synthesizer  and combine them together
2.	Delicate dataset. Except of using widely known dataset such as TIMIT,
the author used the girls 2 hours audio dataset, and 1,000+ recording of <boy, girl> pairs audio speaking the same sentence,
that's maybe unacceptable in reality of training others voice.
3.	Not general. The model was trained only for Kate Winslet's voice transfer. 
If we want to transfer to Obama's voice in our project RandomCNN, 
we need to gather Obama's voice data and train that network again.

and here we have :
It seems that to apply temperature to softmax in Net1 is not so meaningful.
net2 can reach to near optimal when Net1 accuracy is correct to some extent.
We have Over 70% test accuracy
Obviously, sample rate, window length and hop length should be same in both Net1 and Net2.
